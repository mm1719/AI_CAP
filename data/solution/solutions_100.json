For example, if the input list is `[(6, 9), (15, 34), (48, 70)]` and `start` is 2 and `end` is 100, the function should return `[(2, 6), (9, 15), (34, 48), (70, 100)]`.\n\nHere is a Python solution for the problem:\n```\ndef extract_missing(ranges, start, end):\n    all_ranges = [(start, end)]\n    for r in ranges:\n        new_ranges = []\n        for ar in all_ranges:\n            if ar[0] < r[0]:\n                new_ranges.append((ar[0], r[0]))\n            if ar[1] > r[1]:\n                new_ranges.append((r[1], ar[1]))\n            if ar[0] >= r[0] and ar[1] <= r[1]:\n                new_ranges.append(ar)\n            else:\n                new_ranges.extend([(ar[0], r[0]), (r[1], ar[1])])\n        all_ranges = new_ranges\n    return [r for r in all_ranges if r[0] < r[1]]\n```\nThis function works by initializing a list of ranges with the single range from `start` to `end`. Then, it iterates over each range in the input list. For each range, it updates the list of ranges to remove the part of the range that is covered by the current range. Finally, it returns the list of ranges, filtering out any ranges where the start value is not less than the end value."
